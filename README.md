# monitor_script
A simple python script that redirects you to a site whenever its content is changed

You'll need Python 2.7 in order to run this script (in order to run it on windows, you'll have to replace the bash script with its equivalent in batch). First, create a text document called 'compare.txt', where you will store the initial length of the content of the website you want to monitor by runing update.py.Afterwards, you can run the sh script that will run the main py script on watch every 60 seconds.
