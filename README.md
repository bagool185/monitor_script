# monitor_script
A simple python script that redirects you to a site whenever its content is changed

You'll need Python 2.7 in order to run this script (in order to run it on windows, you'll have to replace the bash script with its equivalent in batch - I'll provide it ASAP). First, run update.py to initialize the initial length (it will create a text file called compare.txt. Afterwards, you can run the sh script that will run the main py script on watch every 60 seconds.
