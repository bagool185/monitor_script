# monitor_script
A simple python script that redirects you to a site whenever its content is changed

You'll need Python 2.7 in order to run this script. First, create a text document called 'compare.txt', where you will store 
the initial length of the content of the website you want to monitor. Then, run update.py to initialize the text file with
that length. Afterwards, you can run the sh script that will run the main py script on watch every 60 seconds.
