# monitor_script
A simple python script that redirects you to a site whenever its content is changed

You'll need Python 2.7 in order to run this script.

First, run update.py (python update.py in your cmd or terminal) to initialize the initial length (it will create a text file called compare.txt).

WINDOWS -> save the .bat file and use it in your command prompt as: open_this_pit_up.bat

LINUX -> save the .sh file, use chmod +x in order to make it executable, then use it as ./open_this_pit_up.sh
