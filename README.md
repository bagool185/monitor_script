# monitor_script
A simple python script that redirects you to a site whenever its content is changed

You'll need Python 2.7 in order to run this script.

First, run update.py (you'll need to install the requests module) to initialize the initial length (it will create a text file called compare.txt).

WINDOWS -> run open_this_pit_up.bat

LINUX / MacOS -> save the .sh file, use chmod +x in order to make it executable, then use it as ./open_this_pit_up.sh
